            <p>To make classic croissants, start by mixing flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk into a soft dough and let it rise until
            doubled. Roll the dough into a rectangle and layer it with cold butter, folding and rolling it several times to create
            multiple flaky layers. Cut the dough into triangles, roll each triangle from base to tip, and shape them into crescents.
            Let the shaped croissants proof until puffy, then brush them with beaten egg for a golden finish. Bake in a preheated
            oven until golden brown and crisp, letting the buttery layers shine inside and out, perfect for a fresh, homemade
            breakfast treat.</p>

            <p>To make basic crepes, start by whisking together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 2 eggs, and 1 cup of milk until smooth. Add
            a pinch of salt and 1 tablespoon of melted butter or oil to enrich the batter. Let it rest for about 10–15 minutes while
            heating a non-stick pan over medium heat. Pour a small amount of batter into the pan, tilting it to spread the mixture
            thinly. Cook for about 1–2 minutes on each side until the edges lift and the surface is lightly golden. Serve warm with
            your favorite fillings, such as honey, fruits, chocolate spread, or cheese, and enjoy a delicate and versatile treat
            perfect for breakfast or dessert.</p>

            <h4>Capuns</h4>
            <p>Capuns are Swiss dumplings made by wrapping a flavorful mixture of spätzli dough, dried sausage, and herbs in tender
            Swiss chard leaves, then simmering them in a creamy broth until cooked through.
            To prepare Capuns, start by making a soft dough from flour, eggs, milk, and yogurt, mixing in finely chopped sausages,
            onions, and fresh herbs for flavor
           
            . Blanch Swiss chard leaves briefly to make them pliable, then place a small spoonful of the dough in the center of each
            leaf and roll them into neat parcels
           
            . Arrange the parcels in a baking dish, pour over a mixture of cream and stock, and bake or simmer until cooked and the
            sauce is slightly thickened
           
            . Serve hot, optionally garnished with grated cheese or extra sausage slices, making Capuns a rich, comforting, and
            festive dish that reflects the heart of Swiss Alpine cuisine
           
            .</p>
